# Raspberry-pi-pico-W-controlled-RC-car
This project is a Wi-Fi controlled RC car based on the Raspberry Pi Pico W. The car can be controlled remotely via a web interface hosted on the Pico W. Motor direction and speed are controlled using an L298N motor driver, while wireless communication is handled by the Pico W’s built-in Wi-Fi module.
